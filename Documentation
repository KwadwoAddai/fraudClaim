# Insurance Fraud Claim Detection API

So I built the project with Django not an APi 
This is a basic frontend application that uses a trained model to predict Insurance Claim Fraud

The model was trained with the insurance_data.csv file in jupyter notebook using the RandomForest Algorithm. The accuracy was 76% due to anomalies with the dataset hopefully the dataset you will provide from the Insurance companies wouldnt give that problem.

Next, the trained model (insuranceModel.sav) was saved into the savedModels directory.
In the insuranceApp directory, the urls paths directing the flow of the app is within the urls.py file.
In that same directory the views.py contains the logic of the program.(The codes there have been commented)

To run this code after cloning it,
open the terminal in vscode and make sure you are in the modeltesting directory, then type and run py manage.py runserver

ctrl+click the IPaddress in the terminal to open the form
use the insurance_data.csv to fill the form then click on submit to get the prediction

I will have to explain alot of this but i hope the basic concept is understood

I'm still working on it to make it better and also how to create the APi
